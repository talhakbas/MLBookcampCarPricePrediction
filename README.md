# MLBookcamp_CarPricePrediction
The problem we will solve in this repository is predicting the price of a car.

The plan for the project is the following:
1. First, we download the dataset. https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/CooperUnion/cardataset
2. Next, we do some preliminary analysis of the data.
3. After that, we set up a validation strategy to make sure our model produces correct
predictions.
4. Then we implement a linear regression model in Python and NumPy.
5. Next, we cover feature engineering - to extract important features from the data to
improve the model
6. Finally, we see how to make our model stable with regularization and use it to predict
car prices.
